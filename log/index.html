      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-27 &middot; Friday</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Feeling much better. Had a late start due to the sickness.</li>
          <li>Self-cut hair as usual, then headed to the office.</li>
          <li>Handled some logistics for the summer internship housing.</li>
          <li>Golf practice session with the Korean Graduate Students Golf Club, followed by dinner at the dining hall.</li>
          <li>Focused on grading — about 80% done. Heading home to finish the rest and sleep.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-26 &middot; Thursday</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Held office hours in the morning and answered student questions.</li>
          <li>Fever, headache, and cough throughout the day. Started grading quiz questions but couldn't keep going.</li>
          <li>Left the office at 4pm, took medicine, and ended up sleeping for 15 hours straight.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-25 &middot; Wednesday</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Held the weekly Kepler meeting with co-authors and advisor Daniel Abadi. Presented the current status of the project, outlined next steps, set up a branch for one of the co-authors, and established weekly goals for the team.</li>
          <li>Re-read the Sunstorm VLDB paper and went through the relevant documentation again.</li>
          <li>Continued working through S2PL implementation challenges — the main difficulty is adapting the existing deterministic workload implementation to support interactive transactions.</li>
          <li>Definitely came down with a cold. Bad headache, feeling rough.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-24 &middot; Tuesday</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Continued housing search but the new options were out of budget. Concluded that the previous candidate (Airbnb + car rental) is the better fit overall. Also considered solo housing but prices were too high.</li>
          <li>Will book the 3-month stay tomorrow once the credit card limit allows.</li>
          <li>Reviewed last semester's S2PL prototype of Kepler. Assessing the gap between the old implementation — which assumed a deterministic database — and what's needed now to support interactive workloads. Expecting significant changes before it's paper-ready.</li>
          <li>Set up a recurring weekly meeting with co-workers and advisor, every Wednesday.</li>
          <li>Dinner at Eastern Gourmet. Feeling slightly under the weather — hoping it doesn't turn into a cold.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-23 &middot; Monday</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Continued development on the Kepler research project.</li>
          <li>Attended CMSC624 lecture.</li>
          <li>Did further housing search across Airbnb, Apartments.com, and Zillow — found a strong candidate, shared it with my summer roommate, and reached out to the Airbnb host to clarify details. Good chance we secure it; aiming to close the deal tomorrow.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-22 &middot; Sunday</div>

          <li>Read the paper for this week's reading group meeting.</li>
          <li>Prepared lecture notes for a 1-on-1 C++ mentoring session and held the meeting (~1.5 hours).</li>
          <li>Called my parents.</li>
          <li>Continued looking into housing — searched options in Mountain View, CA.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="log-entry">
        <div class="log-date">2026-02-21 &middot; Saturday</div>

          <li>Built and deployed this personal website using GitHub Pages.</li>
          <li>Looked into housing for the summer — interning at Snowflake in Menlo Park. Searched neighborhoods with a friend and put together a shortlist of options.</li>
          <li>Working through the current CMSC424 assignment to answer student questions on Piazza.</li>
          <li>Explored the intersection of robotics and database systems — looking into areas where DB research could be relevant, such as inter-sensor communication, real-time data collection and storage, and managing large-scale sensor streams.</li>
          <li>Chipotle for lunch, McDonald's for dinner.</li>
        </ul>
